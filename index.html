        <p>
          Hi! I'm a <span class="highlight">full-stack web developer</span> specializing in <span class="highlight">Ruby on Rails</span> and <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>. I just completed General Assembly's 12-week Web Development Immersive program. I'm now hungry for the opportunity to work for a passionate, team-oriented tech company in New York as a junior developer.<br><br>

          I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in <span class="highlight">Mathematics</span> in 2006 but spent the last eight years working as a professional modern dancer in New York City, two years of which were with the historic <span class="highlight">Merce Cunningham Dance Company</span>. Making a website that documented and shared knowledge about the craft of dance was what helped me discover my intense interest in web development and prompted me to make a career transition.<br><br>
          
          I'm especially excited by math-based code challenges and love doing <span class="highlight">Project Euler</span> problems. Check out some of my <a href="https://github.com/jmhinric/project_euler">solutions</a> if you feel inclined.  Besides honing my coding and problem-solving skills, I'm enjoying deepening my knowledge of Rails and Javascript by continuing to develop my past projects.

          <div class="single-description">
            <p>This is my favorite project that I've worked on so far.  It's a simulation of John Conway's math-based, cellular automaton that allows the user to create game states, move the game forward or back in time, change grid sizes, change speeds, and load past game states.  The most fun part of the project was tackling the feature of detecting oscillations and still-life objects in the game.  The project was built with BDD in <span class="highlight">JavaScript</span>, <span class="highlight">JQuery</span>, and <span class="highlight">Jasmine</span>.

            <h3>DanceShare</h3>

          <div class="single-description">
            <p>
              DanceShare was the first project I did in General Assembly's WDI and my first experience in <span class="highlight">Ruby on Rails</span>.  It allows audience members to write reviews of modern dance concerts and uses Yelp's API to get venue information. Users can create dance companies, which have runs of performances, and other users then write reviews.  It includes tests with <span class="highlight">RSpec</span> and <span class="highlight">Capybara</span>.<br/><br/>

              I still care deeply about the field of modern dance and thus about this project.  The most interesting thing to me about DanceShare is that it could aggregate audience feedback across cultures and across time. I wish this had existed seventy-five years ago and had been widely used, because it would contain incredible data about the history of dance, art, and culture.
